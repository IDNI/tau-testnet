"""Canonical transaction signing preimage and signature verification.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`sender_pubkey` is only a claim until its signature is checked, and every
account-scoped rule (balance, sequence, policy clause, approvals) trusts it.
Signatures are verified at mempool admission (`commands/sendtx.py`) and again for
every transaction at block apply, at one site at the top of the apply loop in
`TauConsensusEngine.apply`. Without the apply check a proposer could include a
transfer from any account, or a rule offer or a vote in anyone's name.

The preimage and the verify live here, once, and both paths call them. Two
implementations of a signing preimage would be a consensus split waiting to
happen.

INJECTION POINT
---------------
Tests that need to control the verdict patch `consensus.bls.verify`, which also
decides block header proofs. The backend's verdicts must equal py_ecc
G2Basic.Verify's on every input, or nodes running different backends split on
which transactions apply.
